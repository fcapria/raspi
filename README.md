temp.py

This is a Python script written to run on a Raspberry Pi with a 1-Wire temperature sensor, such as the DS18B20. It reads the temperature, converts it to Fahrenheit, and posts it to a Google Sheet. If the temperature is outside of a set range, the script proceeds to send a text message to  a mobile phone.
